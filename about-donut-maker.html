          Doughnut Maker is cute little clicker game. The goal of the game is to get as many doughnuts as possible.
          Not as good as the real thing. Just kidding, not even close but play this game anyway. 
          Purchase an Auto Clicker or two. This will handle the clicking for you. You can even keep clicking, 
          who doesn't like mouse fatigue. You can purchase Doughnut Multipliers to make your donuts worth more than 1.
          If only that happened in real life.
